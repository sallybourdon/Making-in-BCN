# Welcome to Making in Barcelona

Wow. My own website! Several months ago (and several times) a co-worker of mine asked if I wanted to make my own website and I said 'no.' Well, here I am: I figured while I'm helping with Pop Machina Academy, I may as well learn what our trainees are. Now what? I guess I need to better understand how this template works and then go from there.

## In the meantime...
Let me tell you about myself. I am from the United States and graduated university with a dual masters in Biology and Hispanic Studies. In 2016, I moved to Spain and began teaching English in La Rioja. Soon after, I moved to Barcelona to do the same and I haven't looked back. In 2018, I completed my masters in Interdisciplinary Studies in Social, Environmental and Economic Sustainability at the UAB, where I focused on creating a tool to assess the use of therapeutic gardens on rooftops for the elderly. In July 2019, I began working at Fab Lab Barcelona.
